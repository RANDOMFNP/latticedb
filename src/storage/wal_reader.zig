//! Reading a write-ahead log from outside the process that writes it.
//!
//! `WalIterator` in wal.zig needs a live `WalManager`, so it is only available to
//! the writer. This is the read-only counterpart: it opens the file directly and
//! hands back whole frames, which is what a backup or replication follower needs.
//!
//! ## Why this is safe without coordinating with the writer
//!
//! The writer assembles a frame in memory, writes it in one call at a computed
//! offset, and only then increments `frame_count` in the header. So the header is
//! a publish barrier: every frame below `frame_count` is already on disk in full.
//! A reader that trusts the header never has to guess whether it is looking at a
//! frame still being written.
//!
//! Frames are fixed size, so frame `n` always lives at
//! `WAL_HEADER_SIZE + n * frame_size`. No index or scan is needed to find one.
//!
//! ## Two failures that look alike and are not
//!
//! `FrameChecksumMismatch` is usually **transient**. The publish barrier makes it
//! unlikely, but a large write is not necessarily atomic, so a reader can still
//! catch a frame mid-flight. The right response is to wait and read it again, not
//! to declare the log corrupt. A mismatch that survives several attempts is a real
//! problem; one that clears on retry never was.
//!
//! `Rewound` means the log was truncated while the reader was following it, which
//! happens whenever the writer checkpoints. Frame numbering restarts from zero, so
//! frames the reader has already seen are gone and the numbers it holds no longer
//! refer to the same records. A follower has to start a new generation from a
//! fresh snapshot rather than carry on counting.
